## Back to Working Hard

After a much needed summer break, our team has started working hard once again, and we've accomplished a lot.

We've set up our social medias! We have Twitter (@Scribe_Hacks) Instagram (@scribehacks), so go follow us! We'll be using these accounts to post updates before and during the hackathon. We'll also be using them to give shoutouts to our sponsors and introduce the team.

Our tech team has also been working extremely hard on the website! They're trying to create the best possible user experience so that our website is easy to use, and you can get all the information you need about the hackathon in one place. Unfortunately, our old design had some issues, so they went back to the drawing board to create a new one that can run a lot smoother. We were having some issues with our scrolling getting in the way of the rest of the design. Some words weren't showing, while others weren't showing up quite where we wanted them too. Regardless, we are close to getting our new and improved website up and running and we're so excited to share with you!

They have also been working hard on the Capture the Flag event for the hackathon. The Capture the Flag challenge will consist of having multiple teams attempt challenges to try and get a string called the flag which they receive points for if the string is correct. There are going to be a lot different types of challenges, and they all share will some sort of cryptography or encryption element to them. For this challenge, we're planning on using Python with Flask for the Frontend and Python with SQLite for the backend (keeping track of points and teams). There are going to be so many fun and interesting challenges, and our tech team is so excited to be able to share it with you all.
